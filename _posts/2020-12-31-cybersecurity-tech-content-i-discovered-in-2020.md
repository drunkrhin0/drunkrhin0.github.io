# Cybersecurity & Tech Content I Discovered in 2020

I wrote [this tweet](https://twitter.com/drunkrhin0/status/1344130685817085959) about my favourite cybersecurity and tech content I discovered in 2020. I’ve added a bit more content since I’m not limited by the Twitter character limit. These are in no particular order.

# PortSwigger Web Security Academy

-   Twitter: [@WebSecAcademy](https://twitter.com/WebSecAcademy)

I only tried this the other day but I’m absolutely blown away with the quality of this. They break down concepts through write-ups, video, and vulnerable labs in and easy to understand way. It’s heavily underrated and I think everyone should start with it if they’re looking to move towards web application hacking.

# PentesterLab

Although I’m no stranger and a big advocate for the platform I really dove in and did the Essentials badge recently. Some absolutely fantastic examples of labs and quality writeups.

I’m no stranger to this podcast but Jack’s consistent quality of research, interviews and curation of guests is absolutely incredible. From topics like whistleblowing, social engineering, and famous hacks it’s absolutely worth checking out.

One of the most cheerful people on the internet constantly sending out good vibes. Although I knew of his work prior to this year I never really dug into it until recently going through the YouTube archives finding some quality content in them. STÖK also hosts [Bounty Thursdays](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLF7JR1a3dLOP4p6OqgYh4XEkESQCU-rYh) which is a great way to keep up with the industry.

Like STÖK I was aware of the quality content Ben produces and shares. I recently dove into some of his past work and gained a lot of value from them. [NahamCon2020](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKAaMVNxvLmAD0ZVUJ2IGFFC0APFZ5gzy) was a fantastic way to upskill and the guests he interviews on stream are nothing short of amazing.
